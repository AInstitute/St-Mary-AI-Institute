  - name: Machine Learning Based Whole-Genome Scanning
    icon: ti-world
    content: 'We use deep learning to model the complex associations between genotypes
      &environment, genotypes & traits. '
  - name: Drug Target and Marker Prediction
    icon: ti-layout
    content: We use machine learning algorithms to search for the most relevant genetic
      markers and target and predict the most associated molecules for diseases.  We
      provide the high accurate prediction for your drug design.
  - name: Hidden Pattern Embedding Visualization
    icon: ti-blackboard
    content: We use the latest machine learning methods to learn the hidden patterns
      in your data. We provide visualization of big data having millions of samples
      or features.
  - name: Biochemstry Driven Machine Learning Design
    icon: ti-palette
    content: The solution requires domain knowledge in molecular biology, immunology,
      bioinformatics and computational theory, as well as comprehensive ability in
      algorithm design, software development, biomedicine and other technical fields
  - name: Machine Learning for Ecological & Evolutionary Modelling and Inference
    icon: ti-package
    content: Some ecological theories are not as mature as population genetics model
      (i.e., Wright-Fisher model).  Most of the ecological and evolutionary problems
      are complex and subtle. We use machine learning algorithms to learn the macro(micro)-ecological
      patterns and micro(macro)-evolutionary trajectories in order to better understand
      evolution.
  - name: Crop Health
    icon: ti-pulse
    content: We use machine learning approaches to model the best growing condition
      for plants. We provide machine learning based pest monitor and forecast, plant
      disease identification and pesticide/bio-pesticide evaluation.
  - name: Economy Modelling
    icon: ti-blackboard
    content: Machine learning algorithm for modelling economic trends and stock prediction.
